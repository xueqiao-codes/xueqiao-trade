* Supervisord4j *
=====================

 This is a simple java client for Supervisorâ€™s XML-RPC API.
 There are many third-party client which you can find by visiting: [Third Party Applications and Libraries](http://supervisord.org/plugins.html)
 But no java was found. 
 the client was simple enough, it is depend on no other jars. So you can import into you project easily.
